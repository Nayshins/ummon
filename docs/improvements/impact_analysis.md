# Impact Analysis Visualization Plan

## Objective
Create comprehensive tools for visualizing and understanding the impact of code changes.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Change Impact Model**
   - Design a model for representing potential code changes
   - Create algorithms for propagating impacts through the graph
   - Define impact severity and confidence metrics

2. **Static Impact Analysis**
   - Implement impact detection for function signature changes
   - Detect impacts of class/struct modifications
   - Identify effects of API changes

3. **Dynamic Impact Analysis**
   - Integrate with runtime data (if available)
   - Use historical change data to improve predictions
   - Weight impacts based on usage frequency

4. **Impact Visualization**
   - Create visual representations of change impacts
   - Implement heat maps for affected areas
   - Build dependency chains for change propagation

5. **Pre-commit Integration**
   - Add capabilities to run impact analysis during development
   - Integrate with version control systems
   - Provide feedback before changes are committed

## Dependencies
- Diff generation and analysis libraries
- Visualization components
- VCS integration libraries

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Change impact model and static analysis (3 weeks)
- Phase 2: Impact visualization (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: VCS integration and developer workflow (2 weeks)

## Success Metrics
- Accurate prediction of change impacts in >75% of cases
- Visual representation of potential impacts
- Integration with development workflow
- Reduction in regression bugs
- Positive developer feedback on usefulness
