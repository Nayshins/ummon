# Testing Improvement Plan

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and facilitate future development.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup testing infrastructure**
   - Configure test utilities and helpers
   - Set up mocking frameworks for external dependencies
   - Create test fixtures and sample codebases

2. **Unit Tests**
   - Implement tests for `KnowledgeGraph` operations
   - Test `Entity` and `Relationship` implementations
   - Test language-specific parsers
   - Test query processing logic
   - Test domain extraction functions

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test end-to-end indexing process
   - Test query system with various input types
   - Test server endpoints and responses
   - Test CLI commands with different arguments

4. **Property-based Testing**
   - Implement property-based tests for graph operations
   - Test query system with generated inputs

5. **Benchmarking Tests**
   - Create performance benchmarks for indexing
   - Create benchmarks for query operations
   - Monitor performance changes over time

## Dependencies
- Add `proptest` for property-based testing
- Add `criterion` for benchmarking
- Add `mockall` for mocking dependencies

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Unit tests for core components (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Integration tests for main workflows (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: Property-based and benchmarking tests (1 week)

## Success Metrics
- Code coverage > 80%
- All public API functions tested
- Benchmarks established for key operations
- CI pipeline successfully running all tests
