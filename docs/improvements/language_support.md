# Language Support Expansion Plan

## Objective
Extend language support to cover more programming languages and ecosystems.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Language Parser Architecture Refactoring**
   - Create a more flexible plugin architecture for language parsers
   - Define common interfaces for all language parsers
   - Implement language detection for mixed codebases

2. **New Language Support**
   - Add support for Go (using tree-sitter-go)
   - Add support for TypeScript (using tree-sitter-typescript)
   - Add support for Java (using tree-sitter-java)
   - Add support for C/C++ (using tree-sitter-c/cpp)

3. **Framework-specific Analyzers**
   - Implement specialized analyzers for popular frameworks:
     - React/Vue/Angular for JavaScript/TypeScript
     - Spring/Jakarta for Java
     - Django/Flask for Python
     - Actix/Rocket for Rust

4. **Polyglot Project Support**
   - Add capabilities to track cross-language dependencies
   - Detect and map FFI/language boundaries
   - Map entities across language barriers

5. **Language-specific Features**
   - Implement language-specific relationship types
   - Add language-specific domain concept extractors
   - Support language-specific query filters

## Dependencies
- Add tree-sitter grammars for new languages
- Add specialized parsing libraries as needed

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Parser architecture improvements (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Add TypeScript & Go support (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: Add Java & C/C++ support (2 weeks)
- Phase 4: Framework analyzers & polyglot support (3 weeks)

## Success Metrics
- Support for at least 7 programming languages
- Accurate detection of entities in all supported languages
- Framework-aware analysis for at least 2 frameworks per language
- Cross-language relationship tracking
