# Code Suggestions Plan

## Objective
Implement code suggestion capabilities based on knowledge graph analysis.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Suggestion Engine Architecture**
   - Design patterns and anti-pattern detection system
   - Create suggestion generation pipeline
   - Implement ranking and filtering algorithms

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Identify common code patterns in the graph
   - Detect architectural patterns (MVC, repository, etc.)
   - Find code smells and anti-patterns

3. **Refactoring Suggestions**
   - Generate suggestions for code improvement
   - Identify potential simplifications
   - Detect duplicated or similar code blocks

4. **Security and Performance Suggestions**
   - Identify potential security issues from patterns
   - Detect performance bottlenecks
   - Suggest optimizations based on usage patterns

5. **Implementation Assistance**
   - Suggest implementations for interfaces
   - Generate boilerplate based on existing patterns
   - Recommend test cases based on similar entities

## Dependencies
- Pattern matching algorithms
- Code transformation libraries
- Integration with LLM for generating suggestions

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Suggestion engine architecture (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Pattern detection and refactoring (3 weeks)
- Phase 3: Security, performance, and implementation assistance (3 weeks)

## Success Metrics
- Detection of at least 20 common code patterns
- Accuracy of suggestions > 80%
- Reduced development time for common tasks
- Positive developer feedback on suggestion quality
- Measurable code quality improvements
