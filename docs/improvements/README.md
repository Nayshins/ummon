# Ummon Improvement Plans

This directory contains detailed plans for improving the Ummon codebase. Each document outlines a specific improvement area with implementation steps, dependencies, timelines, and success metrics.

## Improvement Areas

1. [Testing](testing.md) - Implement comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and facilitate future development
2. [Caching](caching.md) - Implement a caching layer to improve performance for repeated operations and queries
3. [Visualization](visualization.md) - Create visualization tools for the knowledge graph to improve understanding
4. [Language Support](language_support.md) - Extend language support to cover more programming languages and ecosystems
5. [Web Interface](web_interface.md) - Create a comprehensive web interface for interacting with Ummon's knowledge graph
6. [Documentation Generation](documentation.md) - Create a system to generate comprehensive documentation from the knowledge graph
7. [Code Suggestions](code_suggestions.md) - Implement code suggestion capabilities based on knowledge graph analysis
8. [Impact Analysis](impact_analysis.md) - Create comprehensive tools for visualizing and understanding the impact of code changes
9. [Git Integration](git_integration.md) - Implement seamless integration with Git repositories
10. [Performance Optimization](performance.md) - Optimize Ummon for performance with large codebases
