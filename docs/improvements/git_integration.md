# Git Integration Plan

## Objective
Implement seamless integration with Git repositories to enhance Ummon's capabilities with version control awareness.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Git Repository Analysis**
   - Add support for cloning and analyzing remote repositories
   - Implement differential analysis between commits
   - Create history-aware code analysis

2. **Change Tracking**
   - Track entity changes across commits
   - Generate evolution histories for entities
   - Identify ownership and responsibility based on commit history

3. **Multi-branch Analysis**
   - Compare entities across branches
   - Detect potential merge conflicts at semantic level
   - Visualize differences between branches

4. **Collaborative Features**
   - Integrate with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket APIs
   - Add PR/MR analysis capabilities
   - Implement code review assistance features

5. **Temporal Knowledge Graph**
   - Extend knowledge graph with temporal dimensions
   - Track entity evolution over time
   - Support querying historical states

## Dependencies
- Git interaction libraries (git2-rs)
- GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket API clients
- Diff and merge analysis tools

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Basic Git repository analysis (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Change tracking and history analysis (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: Branch comparison and PR integration (3 weeks)
- Phase 4: Temporal knowledge graph (3 weeks)

## Success Metrics
- Support for all major Git operations
- Analysis of repository history to enhance knowledge graph
- Integration with at least GitHub and GitLab
- Temporal queries working across commit history
- Positive developer feedback on Git workflow integration
