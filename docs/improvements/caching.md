# Caching Improvement Plan

## Objective
Implement a caching layer to improve performance for repeated operations and queries.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Cache Architecture Design**
   - Define cacheable operations (queries, parsing results, etc.)
   - Design cache invalidation strategy
   - Select appropriate storage backends (in-memory, disk-based)

2. **Query Result Caching**
   - Implement cache for common query results
   - Create cache keys based on query parameters
   - Set appropriate TTL for cached results

3. **Parser Result Caching**
   - Cache AST parsing results to avoid re-parsing unchanged files
   - Use file modification timestamps for invalidation
   - Store intermediate parsing results

4. **LLM Response Caching**
   - Cache responses from LLM for domain extraction
   - Implement semantic caching for similar queries
   - Track cache hit/miss rates

5. **Cache Management API**
   - Add commands to view/clear cache
   - Provide configuration options for cache size/lifetime
   - Implement automatic pruning

## Dependencies
- Add `moka` or similar for in-memory caching
- Add `sled` or similar for persistent caching

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Query result caching (1 week)
- Phase 2: Parser result caching (1 week)
- Phase 3: LLM response caching (1 week)
- Phase 4: Cache management API (1 week)

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in query time for repeated queries
- 80% reduction in parsing time for unchanged files
- Reduction in LLM API costs through cached responses
- Cache hit rate > 70% for common operations
